    /// A DbContext instance represents a combination of the Unit Of Work and Repository patterns such that
    ///             it can be used to query from a database and group together changes that will then be written
    ///             back to the store as a unit.
    ///             DbContext is conceptually similar to ObjectContext.

    /// 
    /// <remarks>
    /// DbContext is usually used with a derived type that contains <see cref="T:System.Data.Entity.DbSet`1"/> properties for
    ///             the root entities of the model. These sets are automatically initialized when the
    ///             instance of the derived class is created.  This behavior can be modified by applying the
    ///             <see cref="T:System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.SuppressDbSetInitializationAttribute"/>  attribute to either the entire derived context
    ///             class, or to individual properties on the class.
    /// 
    ///             The Entity Data Model backing the context can be specified in several ways.  When using the Code First
    ///             approach, the <see cref="T:System.Data.Entity.DbSet`1"/> properties on the derived context are used to build a model
    ///             by convention.  The protected OnModelCreating method can be overridden to tweak this model.  More
    ///             control over the model used for the Model First approach can be obtained by creating a <see cref="T:System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure.DbCompiledModel"/>
    ///             explicitly from a <see cref="T:System.Data.Entity.DbModelBuilder"/> and passing this model to one of the DbContext constructors.
    /// 
    ///             When using the Database First or Model First approach the Entity Data Model can be created using the
    ///             Entity Designer (or manually through creation of an EDMX file) and then this model can be specified using
    ///             entity connection string or an <see cref="T:System.Data.EntityClient.EntityConnection"/> object.
    /// 
    ///             The connection to the database (including the name of the database) can be specified in several ways.
    ///             If the parameterless DbContext constructor is called from a derived context, then the name of the derived context
    ///             is used to find a connection string in the app.config or web.config file.  If no connection string is found, then
    ///             the name is passed to the DefaultConnectionFactory registered on the <see cref="T:System.Data.Entity.Database"/> class.  The connection
    ///             factory then uses the context name as the database name in a default connection string.  (This default connection
    ///             string points to .\SQLEXPRESS on the local machine unless a different DefaultConnectionFactory is registered.)
    /// 
    ///             Instead of using the derived context name, the connection/database name can also be specified explicitly by
    ///             passing the name to one of the DbContext constructors that takes a string.  The name can also be passed in
    ///             the form "name=myname", in which case the name must be found in the config file or an exception will be thrown.
    /// 
    ///             Note that the connection found in the app.config or web.config file can be a normal database connection
    ///             string (not a special Entity Framework connection string) in which case the DbContext will use Code First.
    ///             However, if the connection found in the config file is a special Entity Framework connection string, then the
    ///             DbContext will use Database/Model First and the model specified in the connection string will be used.
    /// 
    ///             An existing or explicitly created DbConnection can also be used instead of the database/connection name.
    /// 
    ///             A <see cref="T:System.Data.Entity.DbModelBuilderVersionAttribute"/> can be applied to a class derived from DbContext to set the
